                        We collect information from you in various ways when you
                        use our Web sites and services. We may also supplement
                        this information with information from other companies.
                        We collect two general types of information, namely
                        personal information and aggregate data. As used in this
                        Policy, the term “personal information” means
                        information that specifically identifies an individual
                        (such as a name and email address), and demographic and
                        other information when directly linked to information
                        that can identify an individual. <br />
                        <br /> Our definition of personal information does not
                        include “aggregate” data. Aggregate data is information
                        we collect about a group or category of services or
                        users from which individual user identities have been
                        removed. In other words, no personal information is
                        included in aggregate data. Aggregate data helps us
                        understand trends in our users needs so that we can
                        better consider new features or otherwise tailor our
                        services. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our
                        collection and use of aggregate data, and we may share
                        aggregate data about our users with third parties for
                        various purposes, including to help us better understand
                        our customer needs and improve our services and for
                        advertising and marketing purposes.

                        <br />

                        Submissions and Customer Service. From time to time we
                        may use surveys, contests or sweepstakes requesting
                        personal or demographic information and customer

                        Automatically Collected Information. We automatically
                        receive certain types of information when you interact
                        with our Web pages, services and communications. For
                        example, it is standard for your Web browser to
                        automatically send information to every Web site you
                        visit, including ours. That information includes your

                        and language, and referring Web site addresses. We may

                        of technology such as cookies and Web beacons to collect
                        information. Among other things, the use of cookies and
                        Web beacons enables us to improve our Web sites and
                        emails by seeing which areas and features are most
                        popular, to count the number of computers accessing our
                        Web site, to personalize and improve your experience, to

                        Web site without re-entering your member ID and/or
                        password. A cookie is a small amount of data which is
                        sent to your browser from a Web site's computers and
                        stored on your computer's hard drive. Most browsers
                        automatically accept cookies as the default setting. You
                        can modify your browser setting to reject our cookies or
                        to prompt you before accepting a cookie by editing your
                        browser options. However, if a browser is set not to
                        accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, some
                        portions of the Web site and services may not function
                        properly.

                      You have 30 (change this) calendar days to return an item
                      from the date you received it. To be eligible for a
                      return, your item must be unused and in the same condition
                      that you received it. Your item must be in the original
                      packaging. Your item needs to have the receipt or proof of
                      purchase.

                      you that we have received your returned item. We will
                      immediately notify you on the status of your refund after
                      inspecting the item. If your return is approved, we will
                      initiate a refund to your credit card (or original method
                      of payment). You will receive the credit within a certain
                      amount of days, depending on your card issuer's policies.
